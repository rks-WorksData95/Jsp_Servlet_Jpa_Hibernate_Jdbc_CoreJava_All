A product is developed according to a planned layout that should result in a functional and aesthetically pleasing outcome. When a designer works on a design for a garment, thought has to be given to make the garment appeal to the target client. It is essential for the designer to keep in mind the psychographics and demographics of the wearer.

 

So when a motif, design or silhouette is visualised as a component of the final garment, the aim must be to give the wearer a well-composed and suitable appearance by experimenting with various elements and principles of design.

 

The elements of design are the building blocks of any design. Compiled skilfully, they create effective visual communication.

 

The elements of design discussed are:

-->         Dot/Point

-->         Various styles of lines

 

Dot/Point

-->         A dot is the basic element of design.

-->         It is the smallest and the simplest unit suggesting its presence.

-->         Dots are the building blocks of everything else in a design.

-->         The size of dots in a design is not related to any kind of illusion of height or length in any garment.

-->         Larger dots create an illusion of increased surface area, making the wearer appear to be wide. So, larger dots are suitable for slim people and inappropriate for those with a heavy body type.

-->         Small dots look best on people with a wide and heavy body structure as the dots have a smaller surface area and create an illusion of slimness. They have the added advantage of looking good even on slim people.

 


Line

A line is a versatile mode of expression. Its various qualities evoke different feelings and each type has distinguished significance.
