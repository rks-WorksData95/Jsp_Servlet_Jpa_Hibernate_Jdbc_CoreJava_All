Tim Johnson added an eighth place finish at one of the world's most gruelling mountain bike stage races to his biking resumé with the close of the 2017 BC Bike Race. Prior to the start of the race, Johnson had never ridden a mountain bike in British Columbia.
BC Bike Race, dubbed the ultimate singletrack experience, is a seven-day epic spanning 300km with a total of 10,000m in climbing. Racers travelled as a unit from Cumberland, B.C. to Whistler, B.C., camping together in the different stops.
For Johnson, the experience harkened back to his days as a "punk little kid who didn't have a driver's license."
"We’d hang out in a tent city like this," Johnson recalls of his early days racing downhill, slalom and cross country. "And that’s exactly the reason why I love mountain biking. To come back and do it on this scale... I would do this for weeks on end if I could.”
Johnson is no stranger to a varied quiver of bikes. As a back-to-back U.S. Cyclocross National Champion, cyclocross bikes have always taken precedent throughout his professional career, but he's also raced professionally on road and mountain bikes.
